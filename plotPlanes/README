Synopsis:
plotPlanes [dat_directory log_file run_number]



Description:
plotPlanes takes in a plaintext run log and binary Nevis dat files and outputs a ROOT file
plotting voltage as a function of time and wire index for each plane and event index.



Expected log file format:

runNumber; lineDriverPortNumber1, lineDriverPortNumber2, ... # comment
# comment



Notes:
Makefile assumes a ROOT installation at "/usr/local/root". Modify as necessary.



Known bugs:

|sample| > 20000 and sample == 0 are symptoms of soft errors in the dat files,
cause to be determined.
These samples are currently set to zero.
Zero-valued samples are ignored in mean and RMS calculations.
